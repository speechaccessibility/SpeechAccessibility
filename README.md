# Speech Accessibility Project
**Website**: [https://speechaccessibilityproject.beckman.illinois.edu/](https://speechaccessibilityproject.beckman.illinois.edu/)

The Speech Accessibility Project intends to make speech technology accessible to people with a variety of neurological conditions, including at least Parkinson's Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.  In pursuit of this goal we have developed:

* A contributor interface that permits people with neurological conditions to upload their speech samples securely and easily in response to simple read prompts and questions,

* A data pipeline that stores recorded speech on a secure server separate from any identifying information,

* An annotator interface that permits human and software annotators to check each audio sample against the prompt text, to code the acoustic and perceptual attributes of the signal, to remove personal identifying information from the audio if necessary, and otherwise to edit the prompt text as necessary so that it matches the recorded audio, and

* Connected to the annotator interface, an administrator interface that permits the selection of curated audio samples, transcripts, and annotations for periodic distribution to other researchers.

All software developed by the Speech Accessibility Project will be distributed open-source through this repository, and through other repositories associated with this organization.  We welcome all types of re-use, and we welcome feedback about the ease of use and security of the software.  

## Technologies / Dependencies

The web based applications are written in C# .NetCore and use javascript and typescript libraries  for various purposes.
