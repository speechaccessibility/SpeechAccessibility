        <p>
            You are being  asked to participate in a voluntary research study that
            is called the “Speech  Accessibility Project.” The purpose of this study
            is to help researchers at  universities and companies to develop
            spoken-language user interfaces that work  for people with atypical
            speech. Software programs that understand speech are  developed using
            machine learning. Machine learning is a software development  method
            that imitates the way humans learn, by testing the software repeatedly,
            and changing its behavior whenever it makes a mistake. In this way, the
            software learns to reduce the risk of similar mistakes in the future. By
            providing examples of the sounds of atypical speech, this study will
            make it  possible for the software to learn how to make fewer mistakes
            when it  encounters atypical speech in the future. Participating in this
            study is all  online and will involve helping your friend or family
            member with a disability  to record sentences and to upload the audio
            recordings to a secure encrypted  storage system. We ask you to help
            your friend or family member with a  disability to provide up to 600
            speech samples or about 5 hours of your time  which you can do any time
            online, at your own pace and convenience. Risks  associated with this
            study are no greater than those in everyday life. There is  no expected
            benefit of this research to you personally; the expected benefit to
            society is that companies and organizations using  your speech
            recordings will be able to train better speech technology for people
            with speech and motor disabilities, which will make technology more
            accessible  for everyone.

                Organizations that will perform this study
            </strong>
            : University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is the lead
            organization that will perform this study.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Sponsor</strong>: The Speech  Accessibility Project is funded by
            a consortium that currently includes five  companies: Amazon, Apple,
            Google, Microsoft, and Meta (parent  company of Facebook). In the
            future, other companies, universities, and  organizations may join this
            consortium as well.
        </p>
        <strong>
            Why am I being asked?
        </strong>
        <p>
            You are being asked to participate in this study because you are an
            adult who assists a person with a  disability to interact with
            computers, and that person has already qualified to  be in the study by
            successfully answering our pre-screening questions and  providing a set
            of speech samples, and that person either is not able to read  prompts
            from the screen, or does not wish to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            We plan to recruit  more than 1,000 people to be in this study. Because
            the purpose of this study is to help organizations develop better
            speech interfaces for technologies, our team needs to gather  many
            different types of speech samples from many types of voices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your participation in this research  is voluntary. Your decision whether
            or not to participate will not affect your current or future dealings
            with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, its partners, or it
            sponsors of this project.  If you decide to participate, you are free to
            withdraw  at any time without  affecting that relationship.
        </p>
        <strong>
            What procedures are involved?
        </strong>
        <p>
            <strong></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We will provide  you with access to a website where you and the person
            that you are assisting  can record up to 600 speech samples. Some  of
            the prompts will instruct you to read a sentence out loud so that the
            person  you're assisting can repeat it out loud. Some of the prompts
            will instruct you to ask the person  you're assisting a question, so
            that they can speak their  answer to the question. You and the person
            that you are assisting can do these  recordings at any time, 24/7, at
            whatever pace you wish. We encourage you to  record at different times
            of day so  that we can learn how your speech  might change throughout
            the day. And  don’t worry about giving  us “bad” samples – all data are
            really helpful. The more diverse our  data set is, the better!
        </p>
        <p>
            You and the person  that you are assisting have the option  to work with
            UIUC to get help. UIUC can provide you with a mentor to help you do your
            recordings, give you advice about your microphone settings, and give you
            tips  for when and where to do your recordings.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may take up to three months to finish recording the 600 speech
            samples. If you will need more than three months, please contact the
            research team at UIUC at
            <a href="mailto:speechaccessibility@beckman.illinois.edu">
                speechaccessibility@beckman.illinois.edu.
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            We will ask the person  you're assisting whether  they consider U.S.
            English to be their first
        </p>
        <p>
            language. People who speak English  as a second language are sometimes
            better recognized by devices that also know multiple  languages. If you
            provide this information, it will be shared with researchers using the
            data.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will also ask the person you're assisting to provide optional  data
            about themselves, such as age, racial  and ethnic identity, and
            questions about how their speech ability may have  impacted their
            everyday life. They are not required to answer any of these  questions.
            This information will only be used to confirm diverse representation  in
            this data collection, and, if provided, will not be shared outside of
            the  UIUC research team.
        </p>
        <p>
            The UIUC research team will review  all of your speech samples, and we
            will edit them to protect your privacy by  removing any references to
            personally identifiable information about you or  others that you might
            have said in your  answers to our question prompts. We will also
            annotate your samples with “tags” that refer to technical  aspects of
            the acoustic signals in your samples. We will not attach your name  or
            email address to these samples;  instead, we will assign a unique
            participant identification code to you and will annotate your samples
            with that  code. Only the UIUC research team will know the “identity
            key” that relates  your email address to your participant identification
            code.
        </p>
        <p>
            The UIUC Speech Accessibility  Project research team has established a
            secure, fully encrypted storage system  at the UIUC Beckman Institute to
            store your samples. We will separately store  your identifiable
            information in a separate secure database. We have also  established a
            secure data sharing mechanism with the partners in our  consortium.
            Right now, our partners are the five company sponsors of this  project:
            Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. UIUC researchers and
            researchers at each of the partners will use the collected speech
            samples to train machine  learning algorithms to perform better  on
            speech recognition tasks. These partners will only have access to  your
            speech samples and to no other data about you.
            The five corporate sponsors  of this research at UIUC have signed a
            legal agreement with the University that sets forth the permitted
            purposes of the speech data collected from this research project. These
            permitted purposes are only for  research and technology development as
            stated here:
        </p>
        <p>
            ·       Your samples  will be kept forever, to assist in research and
            technology development in perpetuity.
        </p>
        <p>
            ·        Your samples are not identified with your name or email
            address, but only with a unique participant code that is only known  to
            the UIUC research team.
        </p>
        <p>
            ·        Your samples will be analyzed  by the UIUC research team to
            verify that the study is being done properly and to provide advice to
            other researchers about how to design or improve future studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            ·        Your samples will be analyzed  and combined with other people’s
            samples to create aggregate  results that will be published in the
            research literature.
        </p>
        <p>
            ·        Your samples will be used to advance  understanding of machine
            learning-related data variances associated with atypical speech
            variations, and eventually to develop products,  technologies, and
            services by  or on behalf of our sponsors to improve communications and
            increase access to  technology, including the creation and training of
            machine learning solutions  and artificial intelligence models for both
            research and commercial purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future, any additional partner organizations in this  consortium
            will sign data use agreements  with the same terms and conditions. For
            these future  uses of your data, we will not ask you to consent  again.
            In other words, the future use of your de-identified data could  happen
            without additional informed consent.
        </p>
        <p>
            In summary, your speech samples will help researchers at UIUC and its
            partner organizations to develop better speech recognition technology
            algorithms and may eventually help commercial products  perform more
            effectively for people with atypical speech.
        </p>
        <strong>
            What are the potential risks and discomforts?
        </strong>
        <p>
            In general, we believe that the risks of your participation in this
            research study are no more than you would encounter in everyday life.
            However, we do recognize  two issues that may be risks in this study,
            and we also have designed measures to minimize these risks.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, you may  get tired. To minimize your tiredness, we have arranged
            to let you record your  speech samples over multiple  sessions. You can
            log in to the system at a time and location  convenient to you, and
            record at your own pace. You can also log out at any time, then log in
            again to  continue recording as you wish. We hope that this flexibility
            and convenience  will minimize any fatigue that you may experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Second, as is  true for almost any online data collection research
            study, there is a risk that  your speech samples could be released for
            purposes and to other  individuals, companies, and organizations beyond
            the purposes to which you have given consent. Please know that the UIUC
            team has designed measures to minimize the possibility of unauthorized
            data  release include the following:
        </p>
        <p>
            ·        Participant  code numbers will be used to annotate  all speech
            recordings; your name and email  address are not attached to any speech
            samples directly.
        </p>
        <p>
            ·       All organizations using your speech  recordings are required  to
            sign a data use agreement, in which  they agree that they will store the
            data securely, that they will prevent  unauthorized access, and that
            they will not attempt to identify you or obtain  any other identifying
            information about you.
        </p>

        <p>
            ·       Researchers  from outside UIUC will not know your name, e-mail
            address, state of residence,  or any other identifying information about
            you. Identifying information will be stored separately from your speech
            recordings, in a database accessible only to UIUC research team members.
            In  addition, as stated above, the UIUC team will edit and annotate your
            speech  samples to protect your privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            ·       You are allowed to withdraw your voluntary consent  at any time
            and request  that all of your data be  destroyed. When you notify the
            UIUC team that you wish to have all of your  speech samples destroyed,
            UIUC will ensure that your speech recordings are  removed from the UIUC
            secure system and will direct our partners that you wish  your data to
            be removed from any copies they have as well.
        </p>
        <strong>
            Are there benefits to participating in the research?
        </strong>
        <p>
            There is no immediate  benefit of this research to you personally.
        </p>
        <p>
            Information obtained  from you in this research  may help in the
            development of commercial products  by UIUC, its research  partners, or
            members of the consortium. There are no plans to provide financial
            compensation to you should this occur.
        </p>
        <p>
            The expected benefit to society is that companies and organizations will
            be able to develop better spoken- language user interfaces so that
            people  with atypical speech  can be as easily understood as other
            people  with typical speech.
        </p>
        <strong>
            What other options are there?
        </strong>
        <p>
            You have the option  to not participate in this study. This study is
            entirely voluntary.
        </p>
        <strong>
            Will my study-related information be kept confidential?
        </strong>
        <p>
            The UIUC  research team has made every effort to protect the audio
            records of your speech  samples. The UIUC team will edit out identifying
            information from your speech  samples (such as your name) and will only
            store your audio files with a participant code number. This participant
            code  number is stored with your identifiable information on a secure
            server at the  UIUC Beckman Institute, and this “identity key”
            information is only accessible  by the UIUC research team. This
            information is necessary in order to pay you  for your participation in
            this project.
        </p>
        <p>
            As described previously, the UIUC team will also listen  to all of your
            speech  samples and edit out any personaly identifiable information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Faculty, staff, students, and others with permission or authority to see
            your study information (such as University  auditors) will maintain its
            confidentiality to the extent permitted and  required by laws and
            university policies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Speech recordings will be distributed only to companies and
            organizations  that have signed a data use agreement, agreeing to
            confidentiality terms specified above.  No other personally identifiable
            information  will be published or presented.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because this is a research project,  we do expect to publish  research
            papers as a result  of this study. These papers  may be in the public
            domain. Research papers will never state your name or any  identifying
            information about you. Optionally, you may choose  to allow the
            university to share anonymized samples of your voice  as part of
            research publications or presentations, but this is not required.
        </p>
        <strong>
            Will I be reimbursed for any expenses  or paid for my participation in
            this research?
        </strong>
        <p>
            The person that you are  assisting will be compensated up to $180 as
            follows: $60 after recording the 200 <sup>th</sup> sample, an additional
            $60 after recording the 400 <sup>th</sup> sample,  and an additional $60
            after recording the 600 <sup>th</sup> sample.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition,  since you are helping them to record  their speech
            samples,  you will also receive compensation for helping them. As a
            named  caregiver you will be compensated with up to $90 as follows: $30
            after they  record the 200 <sup>th</sup> sentence,  an additional $30
            after they record the 400 <sup>th</sup> sentence, and an additional $30
            after they record the 600 <sup>th</sup> sentence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Payments will be made through email using Amazon  ecodes.
        </p>
        <strong>
            Can I withdraw  or be removed from the study?
        </strong>
        <p>
            Yes. You are  free to withdraw your consent and discontinue
            participation at any time by  notifying the UIUC research team by email
            or phone. The UIUC research team also  have the right to stop your
            participation in this study without your consent if they believe  it is
            in your best interests. If you withdraw  consent, the UIUC research team
            will remove  your speech recordings from the UIUC database and will
            notify the sponsors  and partners that they should also remove your data
            from their own  databases using only your anonymized participant code
            number. If you withdraw  consent, your data will not  be used for any
            future  research. If the data you previously provided has been  used to
            inform or create computer code or machine learning algorithms it may
            not be possible for your data to be removed from them.
        </p>
        <strong>
            Will data collected from me be used for any other research?
        </strong>
        <p>
            As stated above, UIUC and its  partners in the Speech Accessibility
            Project consortium will use your speech  samples to advance
            understanding of machine learning-related data variances  associated
            with atypical speech variations, and to develop products, technologies,
            and services  to improve communications and increase access to
            technology, including  computational use, and the creation and training
            of machine learning solutions  and artificial intelligence models
            including for research and for commercial  purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is possible that, in the  future, other organizations will be granted
            access to the data, in addition to  the founding consortium partners
            that are Amazon,  Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. These other
            organizations may be other universities or  other companies. All
            organizations seeking access to the data will be required  to sign data
            use agreements that specify  the same terms as above:  that your speech
            samples will only be used for research and technology development,  that
            your data will be stored securely, and that you may withdraw consent at
            any time. You may not be asked to provide additional consent for these
            future  uses of your data.
